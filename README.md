## Fun

### Advent of Code 2022-2024

I have discovered an [Advent Calendar for coders](https://adventofcode.com/), where every day from 1st to 25th of December they give you new challenge from 2 parts. This is super fun and a great chance to improve skills in coding, algorithms and... optimization.

My progress by the end of Dec 25th:
