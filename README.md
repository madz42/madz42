## Fun

### Advent of Code 2022

I have discovered an [Advent Calendar for coders](https://adventofcode.com/2022), where every day from 1st to 25th of December they give you new challenge from 2 parts. This is super fun and a great chance to improve skills in coding, algorithms and... optimization.

My progress by the end of Dec 25th:

My [GitHub repo](https://github.com/madz42/advent2022) with solutions. Some of them might be still not uploaded, it's because I need to make them look not so ugly first :D
